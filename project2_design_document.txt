---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

>> Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
>> preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course
>> text, lecture notes, and course staff.

               ARGUMENT PASSING
               ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

                 SYSTEM CALLS
                 ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
