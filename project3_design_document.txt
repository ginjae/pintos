>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame

-> 	This 'struct mapping' is defined in 'vm/mmap.h' and used for process to maintain
	its 'mmap_table'.
	It should have
		1. a mapping 'id' that is unique in the 'mmap_table',
		2. the virtual address that mapped pages start from,
		3. the length of mapped file,
	4. the file pointer of mapped file,
	5. list element for 'mmap_table' of the owner process,
	6. list of pages (SPT entry) that the mapping allocated
	struct mapping {
		int id;                 /* Mapping id */
		void *addr;             /* Starting virtual address to store */
		int32_t size;           /* File length */
		struct file *file;      /* Target file */
		struct list_elem elem;  /* List element for mmap_table in process */
		struct list pages;      /* List of pages that the mapping allocated */
	};

	struct thread {
		...
		#ifdef USERPROG
	struct list mmap_table;   /* List of mappings (mmap table) */
	void* data_segment_start; /* Pointer to the starting point of data segment */
	#endif
	}
	: The member 'struct list mmap_table' is for per-process mmap table which
	stores mappings of memory mapped files that the process has.
	The member 'data_segment_start' stores the starting virtual address of data segment
	of the process, and it has the value when the loading succeeds. It is used for 
	checking that the argument address in mmap system call is above the data segment.

	struct page {
		...
	struct list_elem MMAP_elem; /* list elem for MMAP mapping */
	};
	: The member 'struct list_elem MMAP_elem' is added to get in the list of pages that
	is owned by mmap mapping.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.
->Â 	Memory mapped files directly map virtual memory to file contents using
	supplemental page table (SPT), but it marks the SPT entry as "FOR_MMAP" and
	pushes the entry into the list of pages in the mapping. It inserts SPT entry
	into the SPT when mmap system call is invoked. If the page fault occurs,
	then the handler lazy-loads from the corresponding file instead of swap slots.
	The frames allocated by mmap could be evicted in the same way as other evictable
	frame, but the pages and SPT entries by mmap are freed when 'munmap' is called or
	the owner process terminates.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.
->	First, our implementation checks that the address received is below
	stack (PHYS_BASE - 0x800000) and above starting address of data segment.
	Then, we check the new mapping would overlap any existing set of mapped pages
	by 'find_mapping_addr' function which searches mapping in certain virtual address.

---- RATIONALE ----

->	We implement SPT entry to have enum member for its purpose (FOR_FILE, 
	FOR_SWAP, and FOR_MMAP). Therefore, the SPT entries created by mmap mappings
	are distinguished from SPT entries that should be swapped with disk, which
	leads only SPT entries made by mmap mappings to write-back directly to the
	corresponding file. Therefore, the two cases do not share much code, while
	they are handled in the same function when only considering the frame eviction.
	More about mmap mapping, when 'munmap' system calls are invoked manually or
	when the owner process terminates, write-back process should be independently
	implemented in 'munmap' system call function.
