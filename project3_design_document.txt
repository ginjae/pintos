---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

-> We search SPT using the page address provided by user. Then we acquire
	 the page's frame address from returned SPT enrty. After that, our 
	 find_frame function searches the frame table with frame's address
	 as a key for search.

	In our design, if page do exist in the memory, then it's address for frame 
	should be unique per page. Because of that, searching the frame table using
	only the frame's address is enough.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

-> During the eviction, we access the "accessed" bit by calling
	pagedir_is_accessed() to the frame's address. In the dirty bit case,
	we impose more strict criterion and call pagedir_is_dirty() to
	not only the frame's address but also the corresponding user page address
	(upage). This allows us to check that if the page is accessed / dirty.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

-> As mentioned in above, static lock frame_lock is declared & used during
	pushing the new frame into the frame table & finding a victim.
	This prevents the potential race condition by allowing at most one process
	to alter the frame table at the same time.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

-> Most of the page's members are determined from the arguments of
	the load_segment() function in process.c. That way, we can store 
	informations that are passed by the loader during the load phase.

	We defined frame's member so that it can store informations that 
	is required for searching its corresponding SPT entry. It contains 
	its frame's address, corresponding page address, its owner_thread
	that contains the process's SPT, and the boolean is_evictable for
	find_frame function to use while deciding the victim frame to evict.

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

1. static struct block *swap_disk;
-> Swap disk with the data type block.
	 it is a block for swap disk, which is initialized during init().


2. static struct bitmap *disk_map;
-> Mapping of swap disk. false: empty, true: filled.
   It represents the current status of the swap_disk.
   swap_i member of the struct page originates here.


3. static struct lock swap_lock;
-> Lock for synchronization during the swap.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

-> victim frame that is going to be evicted is chosen using the function
	 called find_victim(), which utilizes the second chance algorithm.
	 
	 In a nutshell, second chance algorithm utilizes "clock hand" (ft_cursor)
	 to find a frame to evict. If the frame that is pointed by the ft_cursor
	 is recently accessed (i.e. pagedir_is_accessed() returns true), then
	 function sets that frame's access bit to false & moves cursor to the next frame.
	 Otherwise, it returns the corresponding victim frame after moving cursor.

	 in frame_alloc(), find_victim() is called if the initial palloc_get_page()
	 fails. After the evicted frame is removed from the frame table, swap_frame()
	 is called, which writes the frame's data to the swap disk using the block_write()
	 and update the status of the disk by flipping corresponding bits in the disk_map.

	 Except, if the evicted frame's page is allocated for the mmap, then instead of
	 writing to the swap disk, it writes directly to its file (which is pointed by
	 the page's member, page_file.) using stored offset value in the page.

	 Frame for initial stack allocation is not a target for eviction, as we set
	 its is_evictable boolean to false. While loop during the find_victim() function
	 skips the frame if the frame's is_evictable is false.


>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

-> In our implementation, such situation only occurs in case of swapping.
	 For the swapped frame's page, we call pagedir_clear_page() so that 
	 if process Q tries to access that page again, page fault occurs.

	 We also update the boolean in that page, is_swapped, to true so that
	 process Q can search SPT to find out that its frame is swapped. In
	 that case, process Q can access the swap_disk and read its swapped frame.

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

-> If page fault occurred and yet there is no SPT for the faulted address
	 and the faulted address is valid, we assume that the fault is caused by 
	 the stack growth attempt.

	 If that faulted address is within the stack limit(that is, the address
	 is at least bigger than PHYS_BASE - 8MB), our page fault function allocates
	 new frame for the faulted address's page and push new entry for the SPT.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

-> Deadlock occurs iff the following four conditions hold simultaneously:

	1. Mutual exclusion
	2. Hold and wait
	3. No preemption
	4. Circular wait

	We prevent deadlock by implementing only one lock per data structure,
	and not calling the operation that requires lock if we already calling
	another operation that requires another lock. This prevents Circular
	wait from happening.
	
	In fact, we don't use any lock during the SPT operation
	since SPT is per-process data structure so we don't have to consider any
	race condition for SPT, at least in this implementation.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

-> find_victim function acquires frame_lock at the start of the process
	 and releases the lock after finding the victim to evict. Therefore,
	 only one find_victim can happen simultaneously.

	 If process Q tries to access the evicted frame, it causes page fault
	 since the corresponding page entry is cleared by pagedir_clear_page().
	 So process Q requests a new frame by calling frame_alloc(), which
	 calls palloc_get_page().

	 If palloc_get_page() succeeds, process Q earns a new frame that is 
	 independent to the frame that process P is evicting. Otherwise process Q
	 must wait for find_victim to finish before getting a new frame.

	 Either way, no race condition occurred.

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

-> During page fault, we first allocate new frame with is_evictable = false.
	 If the read is complete, then we set is_evictable = true. This way, we 
	 can prevent find_victim from evicting a frame that is reading 
	 something from a file or a swap disk.

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or do you use some other design?  How do you
>> gracefully handle attempted accesses to invalid virtual addresses?

-> We prevent access by using pagedir_clear_page() so that any future
   access to that page will cause a page fault.

	 If the virtual address itself is invalid, we use system call exit(-1)
	 to prevent such access from happening.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: A single lock for the whole VM system would make
>> synchronization easy, but limit parallelism.  On the other hand,
>> using many locks complicates synchronization and raises the
>> possibility for deadlock but allows for high parallelism.  Explain
>> where your design falls along this continuum and why you chose to
>> design it this way.

-> We choose the "best of both worlds" approach by implementing a single
	 lock, frame_lock, and a boolean, is_evictable. Using a lock, we force
	 processes to evict frame only one at a time, while not allowing a frame
	 to be evicted if the frame is reading something by setting is_evictable
	 false during the read. This way, we can avoid multiple cases of race
	 conditions while not worring about the potential deadlock.

	 Also, swap_lock is acquired & released only in the operations that does
	 not require frame_lock.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
-> 	This 'struct mapping' is defined in 'vm/mmap.h' and used for process to maintain
	its 'mmap_table'.
	It should have
		1. a mapping 'id' that is unique in the 'mmap_table',
		2. the virtual address that mapped pages start from,
		3. the length of mapped file,
	4. the file pointer of mapped file,
	5. list element for 'mmap_table' of the owner process,
	6. list of pages (SPT entry) that the mapping allocated
	struct mapping {
		int id;                 /* Mapping id */
		void *addr;             /* Starting virtual address to store */
		int32_t size;           /* File length */
		struct file *file;      /* Target file */
		struct list_elem elem;  /* List element for mmap_table in process */
		struct list pages;      /* List of pages that the mapping allocated */
	};

	struct thread {
		...
		#ifdef USERPROG
	struct list mmap_table;   /* List of mappings (mmap table) */
	void* data_segment_start; /* Pointer to the starting point of data segment */
	#endif
	}
	: The member 'struct list mmap_table' is for per-process mmap table which
	stores mappings of memory mapped files that the process has.
	The member 'data_segment_start' stores the starting virtual address of data segment
	of the process, and it has the value when the loading succeeds. It is used for 
	checking that the argument address in mmap system call is above the data segment.

	struct page {
		...
	struct list_elem MMAP_elem; /* list elem for MMAP mapping */
	};
	: The member 'struct list_elem MMAP_elem' is added to get in the list of pages that
	is owned by mmap mapping.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.
-> 	Memory mapped files directly map virtual memory to file contents using
	supplemental page table (SPT), but it marks the SPT entry as "FOR_MMAP" and
	pushes the entry into the list of pages in the mapping. It inserts SPT entry
	into the SPT when mmap system call is invoked. If the page fault occurs,
	then the handler lazy-loads from the corresponding file instead of swap slots.
	The frames allocated by mmap could be evicted in the same way as other evictable
	frame, but the pages and SPT entries by mmap are freed when 'munmap' is called or
	the owner process terminates.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.
->	First, our implementation checks that the address received is below
	stack (PHYS_BASE - 0x800000) and above starting address of data segment.
	Then, we check the new mapping would overlap any existing set of mapped pages
	by 'find_mapping_addr' function which searches mapping in certain virtual address.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.
->	We implement SPT entry to have enum member for its purpose (FOR_FILE, 
	FOR_SWAP, and FOR_MMAP). Therefore, the SPT entries created by mmap mappings
	are distinguished from SPT entries that should be swapped with disk, which
	leads only SPT entries made by mmap mappings to write-back directly to the
	corresponding file. Therefore, the two cases do not share much code, while
	they are handled in the same function when only considering the frame eviction.
	More about mmap mapping, when 'munmap' system calls are invoked manually or
	when the owner process terminates, write-back process should be independently
	implemented in 'munmap' system call function.
